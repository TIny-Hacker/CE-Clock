# CE Clock
#### By TIny_Hacker

### Overview:
This is a port of my [Doors CS 7 Clock](https://github.com/TIny-Hacker/DCS-7-Clock) to the TI-84 Plus CE using Celtic CE.
It will work with any shell that supports monochrome icons, as long as Celtic is installed. This is sort of a proof of concept as every shell basically has a clock anyway.

### Installation:
Send CLOCK.8xp to the calculator, and run it whenever you want to update the time.

### Credits (Basically the same as the original):
TIny_Hacker, who wrote the program

RoccoLox Programs, for Celtic CE

BioHazard, who fixed my stupid bug and suggested ideas

Kerm Martian, for [SourceCoder3](www.cemetech.net/sc) which I used to make the icons needed for the program

LogicalJoe, for optimization to reduce the program to < 500 bytes
